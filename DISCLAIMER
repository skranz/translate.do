DISCLAIMER:

Currently this package is a research project, studying how to facilitate conversion of Stata(TM)* .do files to R.  The package uses commands that are inspired by the syntax of .do file commands. At my university, I own a licensed copy of Stata and looked the documentation for .do file syntax. Yet, the package has been written without looking at source code of Stata.

Don't use this package if in your jurisdiction the syntax of a programming language, in particular the syntax of .do file commands, can be protected by copyright and your usage of this package would constitute an infringement of intellectual property of StataCorp. I will not take liability for any misuse of this package.

To the best of my knowledge, programming languages are NOT protected by copyright in the EU and the US. See for example:
